# Save The Universe Version 3

## A Mini-Project Game

## [Save the universe version 3](https://save-the-universe-wk5-mini-project-version3.msoro.repl.co/)

## Added Features:

- For Version 3 I added a stats button in the menu bar. Player can hide or show the stats for hero and alien hit, accuracy of hits and battle number.
- Discovered a bug: After a game is played after clicking no if you want to play again you can just play another round if you clicked any of the modes and it will continue a game play with the previous game state and stats.
- The Bug fix: I created a fcuntion that checks if any any scores are stored, if there are then reload the page. If not then continue with game play.
